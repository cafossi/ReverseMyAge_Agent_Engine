    domain_overview: >
      Nexus Command is a domain-agnostic, multi-agent orchestration layer designed
      to coordinate specialised AI agents as if they were a digital team. The goal
      is to provide strategic intelligence, fast routing, and high-quality execution
      across analytics, planning, research, communication, and automation workflows.
      The Nexus Chief Agent acts as an executive orchestrator: it understands intent,
      frames business impact, selects the right specialist agent, and stitches
      outputs into coherent, executive-ready deliverables.
